#Project's Title: First-Code-Refactor

##Deployed Application: 

This was my first "Challenge" as a student in Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp. 
The goal of the Challenge was to debug some of the HTML, add semantic properties, alt attributes, and make sure the heading attributes were in sequential order. In the CSS, we were asked to consolidate. 

###The following section will be the actions I took:
First, I changed the title to Horiseon. 
After that, I added the alt attributes to the images. 
Next, I looked up the proper semantic HTML properties and added those in the place of some of the divs. I chose to use: header, main, section, and footer. 
To ensure that the heading attributes were in sequential order, I changed the footer heading from h2 to h4. 
My last actions involved the CSS. There were unnecessary classes. I went through each one and made sure that there was only one for each set of commands for the styling. Then I made the necessary changes in the HTML. I was able to delete about half of the CSS without chnanging the style of the website.
