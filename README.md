# First-Code-Refactor
### Deployed Application: 
This project was my first Challenge given as homework by Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp.
(Screenshot attached below.)

## Project Requirements:
1.Consolidate the CSS.

2.Make necessary changes in the HTML for accessibility. 

### Actions I took to complete this:
1. I noticed in the CSS that there were quite a few unnecessary classes. So I deleted the ones that has repeat code and changed the correlating class 
names in the HTML. I was able to delete almost half of the CSS written without changing the design of site when deployed. I also added comments to have
more organization. 
2. In the HTML: added semantic elements in place of some of the divs (header, main, section, footer), added alt attributes to the images, 
changed the footer heading attribute from h2 to h4, and then changed the Title.

#### Things I learned:
I honestly had a harder time with retrieivng the starter code and then setting up my URL to turn in this project, than I did with the actual work.
I did enjoy making the changes and leaving the code much better than I found it. I always enjoy using logic and bringing order to disorganization. 
I hope on my future challenges in the bootcamp, I will be much more simple to turn in as I have learned proper practices.
