# First-Code-Refactor
//To begin for this project, I learned how to download the starter code. The whole process for retrieving starter code from another repository and then being able to push toa different repository was a vaulable lesson to learn. 

//My first task was to make sure the web app had the proper Title. I chose the name of the company "Horiseon" and inserted that in the title tag.

//My next task was to go through all the images included and ensure that they all contained an alt tag with a description of each image. This enables that message to show up in any browser in the event that the image doesn't load promptly or at all. 

//The next task involved me being able to click the links at the top of the page and then they would take me to the section that discussed that topic. The heading "Search Engine Optimization" wasn't functioning in that way. The other two were, so I looked at those to compare them and found that I needed to add "id". Once I did that in the html, it worked perfectly. 

//I added semantic HTML elements: Header, Main, Section, and Footer. I also added some comments.

//The Acceptance Criteria mentioned something about making sure that the heading attributes are in sequential order. My main try to achieve that was to change the footer to h4 rather than h2... As the section above it was h3. Then I made the necessary change in CSS.

//For the CSS consolidation, I began by looking for classes that were unnecessary. In the "main" tag I noticed 3 CSS classes, that all actually did the same thing. So I deleted 2 of them and went to make sure that my HTML reflected all of them having the same CSS class of "search-engine-optimization". I continued this trend through the "section" tag as well. # First-Code-Refactor
